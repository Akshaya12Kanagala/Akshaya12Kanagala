## Introduction
Hello there, this is Akshaya Kanagala and I am studying Computer Scirnce Engineering specialisation on Cyber Security. Something that I really love and admire and my stream of course is that, with the growing of technology and AI comes many difficulties and many threats and that's where we come in place and save people from the problem. 


## Why you should choose me? ðŸ¤”
- Though I was a PCM student and have very little technical background I didn't let that stop me from learning programimg and I've learnt C and also started learning python and anything related to computers and programming always makes me exciting and learn more about it, I am always open to learn whatever I am not good at. And something that really makes amFOSS stand out than other groups is the on how there are mentors associated for every single person of the group which I feel like is such a great thing a club could ever offer.
## What are my goals for the next six months? And how am I planning to accomplish them?
- Technically I wanna learn more about  python and other languanges and explore my intrests apart from computers I also wanna learn Malayalam and make more friends at college.
## How would I contibute back to the club?
- I am ready to give my everthing to the club and and would do everything the club and the members expect me to do not just work related to computer and future taks but I am open for everything.
## Thoughts and feedback on Praveshan process
- As someone who is not so familiar with programming and computers I found it difficult in the beginning and since the recruitment process started and most of it was online I kind of feel like it's a disavantage as most of are not aware about the OS so it would've been nice if there was a physical meeting or session where you could guide us in the beginning it woul've been great and all those who have been trying for the club would've started on the same page but still the references that was given were very helpfull too
